### Prerequisites

Before running tests, you must start `truffle develop` to run a local
blockchain to ensure web3 tests _actually_ pass. You can do this by
simply running the `npm run truffle` command from the root of the
project.

### Running test

Tests are defined in the `test/` directory and are invoked with
[ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava). To run the tests, simply run:

```sh
$ npm test
```
